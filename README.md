Belly Button Biodiversity Websit: https://jennykardashov.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from the North Carolina State Public Science Lab, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Completed the following steps:

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. 
7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
